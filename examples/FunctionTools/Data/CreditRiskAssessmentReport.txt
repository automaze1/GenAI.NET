ANUME        INTERNATIONAL CO LTD - 829552___________________________PAGE NO.                                                       : 7

                                                     SUDAN     - ECONOMIC OVERVIEW

       Sudan    lies at the  crossroads of Sub-Saharan Africa and           the Middle East, bordering       the Red Sea.     It shares  its
       border with    seven    countries:   Libya,  Egypt, Chad,     the Central African Republic,        South Sudan,      Ethiopia,   and
       Eritrea.
       The White and Blue Niles meet         in Khartoum,   its capital, merging   to become    the Nile River, which    flows all the way
       to  the Mediterranean     via Egypt. Sudan      has   a Sahelian   belt with desert    in the  far north,  fertile land  in the Nile
       valleys and   the Gezira   region, with   land used   for farming and    livestock across   the  rest of the country,  from Darfur
       to Kassala, via   the states of Blue Nile and Kordofan.
       For most of   its independent history,    the country has    faced substantial    internal conflict that has weakened      its ability
       to play a  leadership   role  in the region. This   includes  two of the   longest-lasting civil wars on    the African continent,
       and conflicts   in Darfur, South Kordofan, and Blue Nile. Under the          terms of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement
       in 2005, South Sudan seceded         from Sudan    in 2011 and became       the 54th  independent state of Africa.
       The   secession    of South Sudan       led  to multiple   economic    shocks,    including  the  loss  of oil  revenue    that had
       accounted     for more   than   half of the Sudan government’s         revenue    and  95%    of its exports. This    has  reduced
       economic growth and       resulted   in double-digit consumer price      inflation, which,  together with   increased   fuel prices,
       triggered violent protests    in September 2013.
       The high    incidence of conflict, particularly past     fighting that  led to South Sudan’s secession,         has  led to  a large
       population of    refugees and    internally displaced persons. Sudan        is now a source, destination, and       transit country
       for irregular migration,   including  refugees and asylum-seekers using         the East African North-bound migratory         route
       through    Libya  to  Europe.    The   country   hosts  an   estimated   800,000 South Sudanese           refugees    and  330,000
       refugees and asylum seekers        from Eritrea, Syria, Ethiopia, CAR, Chad, and Yemen.
       Continuous    food price hikes and     longstanding grievances      for over thirty years of   rule led to mass demonstrations
       that started  in December 2018 and culminated          in the removal of the    then-President, Omar Hassan El-Bashir,          from
       power    in April 2019. This   led  to the formation of a Transitional Government          in September 2019       that carried out
       ambitious    economic     and   social  reforms   and   engaged     in peace    negotiations with    armed    groups    to  address
       conflicts and grievances across       the country. This    led to the signing of   the Juba Peace Agreement with nearly all
       armed opposition groups       in October 2020.
       A year    later, in October 2021,     a military  takeover   took place. Key government structures were dissolved               and
       terms of the 2019 constitutional charter suspended.          In early January 2022,     the Prime Minister stepped down after
       his efforts  to  reach  a political settlement between domestic stakeholders             failed. In December 2022,       a Political
       Framework Agreement         (PFA) was signed, between        the military and a number of political parties,      in an attempt    to
       relaunch   the country’s    transition to civilian government and hold elections         in two years. A second phase of         the
       political process was     launched    in January 2023, aimed at        reaching   consensus on     key  issues and    inviting non­
       signatories   to join the process, by   the end of which a     final agreement would be signed marking          the beginning of a
       new   transitional period. However, a political deadlock prevailed between domestic stakeholders                in the military and
       broader security apparatus, armed groups, political parties, and civil society until April 2023, when a              failed political
       process saw an eruption of conflict between           the Sudanese Armed Forces          (SAF) and    the Rapid Support Forces
       (RSF).
       The    situation   in  Sudan     has   been    characterized     by   escalating    conflict  since April    15th with   significant
       consequences       for the   population.   The   unrest   has   affected  individuals,   social  structures,   infrastructure,  and
       economic conditions. The ongoing         tensions have    triggered a humanitarian crisis by displacing,       injuring, or causing
       the death of thousands of people. Reports          from  the United Nations    indicate  that, as of September 2023, over        five
       million  individuals have   fled their homes and sought       refuge  in Sudan or neighboring countries. Additionally, many
       who had previously sought         refuge  in Sudan    have been    forced   to return  to their countries and endure unlivable
       conditions. The state of Sudan's hospitals        is dire, with over 80% of them out of service, which         is exacerbating   the
       deteriorating   situation.  The widespread       destruction    of Sudan’s     economic    foundations     has  set  the  country's
       development back by several decades and hindered              its growth potential.
